# pygame_slide_puzzle
Very basic slide puzzle program inspired by the Pygame subreddit challenge (https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/4z36w8/challenge_slide_puzzle/).
The code is ugly and needs better organization, but my main goal was to get my first complete programming project running (and not just another prototype).

Run main.py, then use the mouse to play. Close the window to exit the program.
